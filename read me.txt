// visualization
--just open mainFileVis and select the problem number then
 run the code and all figures will be shown and saved automatically in results images folder
-- all figures have already been saved 
-- new: run mainFileVisMathAverage to visualize boxPlot for all mathematical 
functions in one figure and ttest for each measure, the results will be saved in
results images/mathAverage


// execution
-- for running the algorithms codes or modifing the parameters go to source codes folder
-- the results that have already been saved are available in results folder

// docs folder: contains pseudocodes and technical reports

// Note:
--in 1-rosen-rastrigin and -rosen-sphere experiments, in vlmopso,m-mopso,-mopso the rep size is set to 100 , 
but in the other experiments it is set to be equal to popSize. 
so in those 2 experiments the NDS metric is the best in nsga2
--in WSN there is no repository in vlmopso, so the vlmopso was superior in terms of execution time
--in mathematical experiments the repSize was not determined in the last iteration in both vlmopso,m-mopso
but it is determined in mopso
